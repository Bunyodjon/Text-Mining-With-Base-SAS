# Text-Mining-With-Base-SAS

This SAS script was a part of my project with Dr. Bailer. Dr. Bailer has a book in SAS and he is writing a new chapter about working with
with text data. So, this script is my contribution to the book. Hopefully, Dr. Bailer finds it useful and uses this as an example in his book. 

### This SAS script does three tasks: 
1) Scraps two speechs from a public website 
2) Creates a spider plot with 10 Emotions grouped by a president's speech 
3) Creates Time Series plot with Sentiment score grouped by presidents
